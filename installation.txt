RUN THESE COMMANDS (these are temporary, I'll make easier guide soon)
------------------

- Install Anaconda virtual environment -
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

After executing the previous command it will bring up a screen to accept the software license agreement.
Next, press `ENTER`, then press `q`, then type "yes" when it asks if you accept the terms. Next,
press `ENTER` to confirm the location of the installation. Lastly, type 'yes' when it asks if you
would like to initialize by running conda init. Now, close and reopen your terminal to make sure that
anaconda is running.

- Install Flask within Anaconda environment -
$ conda install -c anaconda flask

- Uninstall Anaconda virtual environment -
$ rm -rf ~/miniconda3
