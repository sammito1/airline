# airline
Simple (mock) airline website built using (but not limited to) Flask, Jinja, and PostgreSQL. User information is stored securely (passwords are hashed) but I still do not recommend uploading sensitive information through the site.

## Live Site
[Click here](https://juno-aviation.herokuapp.com) to visit a live deployment of the website.

## Demo Video
[Click here](https://streamable.com/0o14pz) to watch a demo video of the app in action as of December 10th, 2020. Note that this video is missing a few features relative to what is on the live website.
