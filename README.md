# airline
Simple (mock) airline website built using (but not limited to) Flask, Jinja, and PostgreSQL.

## Installation, Setup
This app runs best on python 3.7 and above, so please have that installed.

Simply run the setup file as shown:

```$ ./setup.sh```

And whenever you want to start the server for the web app, run (preferably in a separate terminal tab):

```$ ./start_server.sh```

Now, you can visit the web app by going to the localhost link given in the output.

If the setup file didn't work, please attempt to install the packages needed manually in pip3. The setup file may not work for those trying to run this on windows.
