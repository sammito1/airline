# airline
Simple (mock) airline website built using (but not limited to) Flask, Jinja, and PostgreSQL. User information is stored securely (passwords are hashed) but I still do not recommend uploading sensitive information through the site. Also note that the application is best experienced on medium-sized mobile devices (iPhone 6 or larger) and standard desktop displays.

## Live Site
